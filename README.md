# text-dungeon-crawl
Text Dungeon Crawl is a simple text based game in Python. Traverse a small dungeon and fight monsters.

This is my way of learning to code in Python. So, here is a simple little text based game I created to get comfortable in Python 
and learn the language.


How to Run:
## Check that you have Python 3 installed on your machine ##
> Download the .py file to a dirctory on your computer.
> Open powershell/command line of choice
> Navigate to the directory your file is in 
  ex. $ cd <file-path>
> run the program
  ex. $ python TextDungeonCrawl.py
> Play the Game!!
